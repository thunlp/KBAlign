Some 300,000 arrived from Asian and North African nations as part of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. Among them, the largest group (over 100,000) was from Iraq.

The Sheba'a Farms provided Hezbollah with a pretext to maintain warfare with Israel. The Lebanese government, in contravention of the UN Security Council resolution, did not assert sovereignty in the area, which came under Hezbollah control. In the Fall of 2000, talks were held at Camp David to reach a final agreement on the Israel/Palestine conflict.\n4. It also led to heightened superpower tension. Following the war, both Israelis and Egyptians showed greater willingness to negotiate. On 18 January 1974, extensive diplomacy by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger led to a Disengagement of Forces agreement with the Egyptian government and on 31 May with the Syrian government.. The war was the catalyst for the 1973 oil crisis, a Saudi-led oil embargo in conjunction with OPEC against countries trading with Israel.\n5. The Egyptian leader created a new psychological climate in the Middle East in which peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours seemed possible. Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel. Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the Peace Now movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs..

The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The Arab League reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis.\nNow the question is: What were the key outcomes and implications of the Camp David Accords signed in 1978, and how did they shape the Middle East conflict and Israeli-Arab relations?\nPlease answer this question.", "The Camp David Accords were a peace treaty signed on September 17, 1978, between Israel and Egypt, facilitated by the United States under the leadership of President Jimmy Carter. The key outcomes and implications include: \n\nThe Camp David Accords, also known as the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, officially known as the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. This treaty was signed on March 26, 1979, in Washington, D.C. It marked a significant turning point in the Middle East conflict, as it was the first time an Arab state had formally recognized Israel's right to exist.\n\nThe Accords led to Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War, in exchange for a peace treaty with Egypt. This withdrawal was completed in 1982, and Egypt has maintained its peace treaty with Israel to this day.\n\nThe Camp David Accords also established a framework for future peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including the Palestinians. However, these negotiations have been slow and challenging, and a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains elusive.\n\nThe Accords had significant implications for Israeli-Arab relations, as they paved the way for Israel's integration into the international community and recognition by the Arab world. The treaty with Egypt helped to legitimize Israel's existence and provided a model for future peace agreements with other Arab states.\n\nThe Accords also had significant regional and global implications, as they marked a shift in the Cold War balance of power in the Middle East. The US had managed to mediate a peace treaty between two key players in the region, and this achievement helped to solidify the US position as a key player in Middle East diplomacy.\n\nThe Accords' success was also seen as a model for future peace negotiations, and they have been studied and emulated in various international conflicts around the world."]}

Most felt that many Palestinians viewed the peace treaty with Israel as a temporary measure only. Many Israelis were thus anxious to disengage from the Palestinians. In response to a wave of suicide bomb attacks, culminating in the Passover massacre (see List of Israeli civilian casualties in the Second Intifada), Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield in March 2002, and Sharon began the construction of a barrier around the West Bank.\n3. Begin actively supported Gush Emunim's efforts to settle the West Bank and Jewish settlements in the occupied territories received government support, thus laying the grounds for intense conflict with the Palestinian population of the occupied territories.. In November 1977 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat broke 30 years of hostility with Israel by visiting Jerusalem at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Sadat's two-day visit included a speech before the Knesset and was a turning point in the history of the conflict.\n4. At the time Israel reportedly obtained information from some 18,000 Palestinians who had been compromised, although fewer than half had any proven contact with the Israeli authorities.  Human rights abuses by Israeli troops led a group of Israelis to form B'Tselem, an organization devoted to improving awareness and compliance with human rights requirements in Israel..

However, Gemayal was assassinated before an agreement could be signed, and one day later Phalangist Christian forces led by Elie Hobeika entered two Palestinian refugee camps and massacred the occupants. The massacres led to the biggest demonstration ever in Israel against the war, with as many as 400,000 people (almost 10% of the population) gathering in Tel Aviv. In 1983, an Israeli public inquiry found that Israel's defence minister, Sharon, was indirectly but personally responsible for the massacres.\n7.

Germany and Britain also participated. In response to over a hundred rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities, Israel began an operation in Gaza on 14 November 2012, with the targeted killing of Ahmed Jabari, chief of Hamas military wing, and airstrikes against twenty underground sites housing long-range missile launchers capable of striking Tel Aviv.\n7. Talented small town Mizrahi social activists, unable to advance in the Labour party, were readily embraced by Begin.

Later that year, the Israeli electoral system was changed to allow for direct election of the prime minister. It was hoped this would reduce the power of small parties to extract concessions in return for coalition agreements. The new system had the opposite effect; voters could split their vote for prime minister from their (interest based) party vote, and as a result larger parties won fewer votes and smaller parties becoming more attractive to voters. It thus increased the power of the smaller parties. By the 2006 election the system was abandoned.\n2. Oslo Accords. In the 1992 elections, the Labour Party, led by Yitzhak Rabin, won a significant victory (44 seats) promising to pursue peace while promoting Rabin as a \"tough general\" and pledging not to deal with the PLO in any way.

On 18 January 1974, extensive diplomacy by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger led to a Disengagement of Forces agreement with the Egyptian government and on 31 May with the Syrian government.. The war was the catalyst for the 1973 oil crisis, a Saudi-led oil embargo in conjunction with OPEC against countries trading with Israel.\n4.
