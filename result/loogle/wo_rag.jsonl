{"id": 5, "prediction": ["Assistant: The Israeli electoral system underwent a significant change in December 2023, which aimed to increase the representation of smaller political parties in the Knesset. The previous system, known as the \"winner-takes-all\" system, awarded all of a party's electoral seats to the candidate who received the most votes in a particular constituency. However, this system often favored larger parties at the expense of smaller ones, leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the new electoral system, known as the \" proportional representation\" system, was introduced. Under this system, seats in the Knesset are allocated based on the proportion of votes each party receives in a constituency. This means that smaller parties have a better chance of gaining representation, as they can win seats even if they do not win the most votes in a specific constituency. This reform was intended to promote greater political diversity and representation in the Israeli parliament.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Israeli electoral system has undergone several changes throughout its history, with the current system being the result of a series of reforms over the past few decades. The most significant of these changes was the introduction of proportional representation in the 1990s, which aimed to address the issue of political fragmentation and improve the functioning of the Knesset.\n\nOverall, the change in the Israeli electoral system in December 2023 represented a significant shift towards a more inclusive and representative political system, with the goal of giving smaller parties a greater voice in the Israeli government."], "ground_truth": "The Israeli electoral system was changed to allow for direct election of the prime minister.", "input": "User: You are an expert who have read a lot of knowledge base.
